# Passphrase Generator v.3
By: Alayna Ferdarko

## Version 3 (February 3, 2025)
Welcome to the third (and possibly most awesome) version of the Passphrase Generator! 🎉 This time, we're bringing:
- A sleek GUI built with `tkinter` for a snazzy user experience
- Persistence! Your favorite passphrases can now be saved to a file, so you never lose a good one.
- A library of 303 words (yes, 303!) for generating ultra-secure passphrases that'll make hackers shake in their boots. I spent entirely too much time raking my brain for fun words over the course of three versions of this program, so please take the time to share this with your friends and maybe consider making a small donation to my **Ko-fi**, it is very much appreciated!

## What You Need:
- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher should work just fine!)
- `tkinter` (don't worry, it comes with Python—no extra downloads!)
- Just the usual Python libraries—no crazy dependencies here.

## Getting Started:
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository (feel free to make it your own!).
3. **To run the app**: Simply double-click the `passphrase_generator_v3.py` file, and the app will launch!
   
   (No need to open the terminal—just a click and you're good to go!)

## What You Can Do:
- **Spin**: Hit the spin button and let fate decide your next passphrase! 🔮
- **Lock/Unlock**: Got a word you love? Lock it in place and keep it safe while the other words change. 🔒
- **Like**: Found the perfect passphrase? Save it for later by hitting "Like." It's like adding to your collection of digital treasures. 💎
- **Show Saved**: Forgot what you saved? No worries! Check out your saved passphrases anytime. 🗂️

## Features:
- Spin a random passphrase from our massive word list.
- Lock specific parts of the passphrase to keep them unchanged while the rest shuffle.
- Save your favorite passphrases to a file for quick retrieval.
- View all saved passphrases within the app (because you know you’ll want to show off your favorites).
